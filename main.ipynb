In a post on Instagram on Thursday, April 6, the striker disavowed a video his club has posted to launch the season-tickets sales for the next season - a video in which he appeared almost alone. It included segments from an in-house interview of which he said he was not informed of the purpose.\\n\\nParis Saint-Germain has apologized, but after disputes with the French Football Federation (FFF) over image rights in March and September 2022, Mbappé has confirmed that he is particularly watchful about the use of his name and image.\\n\\nHis fight for greater player power is not quite universal. The ability to lobby institutions and employers is a privilege of superstars, and Mbappé exercises it by advocating for the interests of said stars, who also aspire to maximize their share of football\\'s revenues.\\n\\nAt the end of the negotiations on his contract extension in May, the forward did not obtain full control of his image rights (which Real Madrid would have offered him). But he had warned a few weeks earlier: \"Football has changed, and it seems right to give [us] the right to have a say on our name, [on] what it is associated with.\"\\n\\nBy ignoring this warning, PSG incurred the wrath of its figurehead, and highlighted its state of dependence on him. With Neymar and Lionel Messi not certain of staying at the club next season, the club has no team to \"sell\" to its supporters, only Mbappé. The paradox is that he deplores his own weight within the club, whose sporting and commercial development is excessively focused on him. But the player enjoys, even claims, the status of savior that he also holds in the French national team.\\n\\nHis choice to stay in Paris was partly due to the guarantee that he would be more influential than in other clubs, where the institution remains above individuals. His entourage even had to deny he had obtained some control of the club\\'s sporting strategy. But this strategy is once again proving to be flawed today, as PSG is having a poor season, marked by an early elimination in the Champions League followed by a series of poor performances in Ligue 1.\\n\\nWith a disappointing Messi and a regularly injured Neymar, PSG is unfortunately nothing more than \"Kylian Saint-Germain\" which sums up its lack of real sporting strategy - which has been replaced by a casting strategy. More than ever, the club and the player need to build a real team around him, rather than a patchwork of individualities that will sooner or later highlight the limits of his capacity to be the savior.\\n\\nParis still lacks a coach whose qualities, experience and prerogatives would ensure him full authority over the players in order to develop a game plan over time. Without this full legitimacy, he will be condemned to making do with an assemblage of stars better designed to sell jerseys than to sweat in them. Given the immunity of the man most responsible for these repeated failures, club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, the idea of extending Mbappé\\'s power is not entirely far-fetched. \"KSG\" would probably get better results than \"QSG\", as some critics nickname the Qatar-owned club. After all, the player and his entourage have already demonstrated their strategic intelligence.\\n\\nThe urgency is, in any case, to make the forward a part of a real team, and not to put the entire team at his exclusive service, allowing him to be \"above the institution\", which was the error previously committed with Zlatan Ibrahimovic. PSG needs to build a team capable of winning even on nights when Mbappé is in poor form.\\n\\nFor Mbappé, the stakes are high. He needs to avoid making his decision to stay in such an immature club turn into a mistake for his own career. Lately, on the pitch, he has expressed a weariness that PSG would do well to worry about before it translates into a desire to leave. If he were to leave, what would be left?', 'source': {'uri': 'lemonde.fr', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Le Monde.fr'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://img.lemde.fr/2023/04/10/0/0/5118/2559/1440/720/60/0/2fb4697_1681116008912-000-33cj7mz.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.04313725490196085, 'wgt': 25, 'relevance': 25}\n"
